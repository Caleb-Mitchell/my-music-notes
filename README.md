# MY MUSIC NOTES

Production version of the site served at [mymusicnotes.net](https://www.mymusicnotes.net).

My final project for course CS50, offered online by Harvard University.

This was originally built in Python using Flask and Sqlite, but rebuilt here using more recent knowledge gained through studies at Launch School. This new implementation is written in Ruby, using Sinatra and PostgreSQL. The website is hosted via Heroku, and the database is provisioned by Railway.
